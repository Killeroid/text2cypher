Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

# Python Project Rules

## Package management

This project uses uv. Do not use pip, pip-tools, poetry, or conda.

- Add runtime dependency: `uv add <package>` (writes to `[project.dependencies]`)
- Add dev dependency: `uv add --dev <package>` (writes to `[dependency-groups]` per PEP 735)
- Remove dependency: `uv remove <package>`
- Sync environment from lockfile: `uv sync`
- Regenerate lockfile from constraints: `uv lock`
- Upgrade locked versions: `uv lock --upgrade`
- Commit `uv.lock` to version control (current uv guidance is to commit it for applications, CLIs, and libraries)

## Running code

Always use `uv run` to execute Python code and tools. Never call `python`, `pytest`, `ruff`, or other tools directly. They may not resolve to the project's virtual environment.

- Run a script: `uv run python script.py`
- Run a module: `uv run python -m module_name`
- Run a tool: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`
- One-off tool (not a project dependency): `uvx <tool>`

## Creating New Projects

- Application or CLI package: `uv init project-name`
- Library without a console script: `uv init --lib project-name`
- Internal script or non-package project: `uv init --no-package project-name`
- Always use `pyproject.toml` for metadata (PEP 621). Never create `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, or `requirements.txt`.

## Testing

- Framework: pytest
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Test files go in `tests/` at the project root
- Test file naming: `test_*.py`
- Test function naming: `test_*`
- No `__init__.py` needed in `tests/`
- Coverage: `uv add --dev coverage`, then `uv run coverage run -m pytest` and `uv run coverage report`

## Continuous Integration

Use `astral-sh/setup-uv@v7` in GitHub Actions. Let uv install Python and sync the locked environment; do not add a separate `actions/setup-python` step unless the workflow has a specific non-uv requirement.

## Linting and formatting

- Tool: ruff (handles both linting and formatting)
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .`
- Lint and auto-fix: `uv run ruff check --fix .`
- Format: `uv run ruff format .`
- Check formatting: `uv run ruff format --check .`
- Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`

## Type checking

- Tool: pyrefly (preferred), ty, or mypy
- Run: `uv run pyrefly check`, `uv run ty check`, or `uv run mypy .`
- Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.pyrefly]`, `[tool.ty]`, or `[tool.mypy]`

## Code style

- Follow ruff's defaults for formatting (88 char line length, double quotes, spaces)
- Import sorting is handled by ruff (`isort` rules enabled via `select = ["I"]`)
- Do not add `# type: ignore` comments without an error code

## Pre-commit hooks

- Tool: prek (preferred) or pre-commit
- Install prek hooks: `uvx prek install`
- Install pre-commit hooks: `uvx pre-commit install`
- Do not install pre-commit or prek with pip. Use `uvx`.

## What NOT to do

- Do not create or activate virtual environments manually. uv manages `.venv/` automatically.
- Do not install packages globally or with `pip install`.
- Do not create `requirements.txt` for dependency management. Use `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
- Do not run `python setup.py` commands.
- Do not add dependencies to pyproject.toml by hand. Use `uv add`.
- If you must edit pyproject.toml directly, write dev dependencies under `[dependency-groups]` (PEP 735), not the legacy `[tool.uv.dev-dependencies]` table.
